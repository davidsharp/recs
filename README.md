David's Recommendations as YAML lists
---

Each list exists as a series of Yaml 'documents', the first document being info on the list itself, and the rest of the documents being the list (for readbility and for my own sanity while writing)

Current lists in this repo:
- [Switch games (WIP)](./switch-games.yml)
